# Artist Import Fix Summary

## Issue Description

Artists were not being created during the NFT import process, even though creator data was available in the indexed NFT data.

## Root Cause

The issue was a mismatch between data structures:

- The search API returns NFTs with an `artist` field containing creator information
- The import handler expected a `creator` field
- When NFTs were passed from the import page to the import handler, the `artist` field was not being mapped to `creator`

## The Fix

### Modified File: `src/lib/importHandler.ts`

Added logic to handle both `creator` and `artist` fields:

```javascript
// Handle creator/artist data - support both 'creator' and 'artist' fields
let creatorData = nft.creator;

// If no creator but we have artist data (from ExtendedArtwork), map it to creator format
if (!creatorData && (nft as any).artist) {
  const artistData = (nft as any).artist;
  creatorData = {
    address: artistData.walletAddress || '',
    username: artistData.name || undefined,
    avatarUrl: artistData.avatarUrl || undefined,
    // ... other fields mapped with defaults
  };
}
```

## How It Works

1. **Indexing Phase**: NFTs are fetched from APIs (OpenSea/Tezos) with creator data and stored in `ArtworkIndex` table
2. **Search Phase**: The search API returns indexed NFTs with creator data in an `artist` field
3. **Import Phase**:
   - The import handler now checks for both `creator` and `artist` fields
   - Maps the `artist` field to the expected `creator` format
   - Passes creator data to the unified indexer for processing
4. **Processing Phase**: The `UnifiedIndexer` creates/updates artist records and links them to artworks

## Testing the Fix

To verify the fix is working:

1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Go to the Import page
3. Search for NFTs (or run the indexer)
4. Select NFTs that show artist information in the UI
5. Import them
6. Check the database to verify artists are created and linked

You can also run these scripts to verify:

- `node scripts/check-artists.js` - Shows artists in the database
- `node scripts/check-import-status.js` - Shows import status and artist links

## Important Notes

- The fix only applies to new imports after the change
- Previously imported NFTs without creator data will not retroactively get artists
- NFTs that genuinely have no creator data (like the "Bathing in the Ganges" example) will still import without artists
- The system correctly handles cases where creator addresses are invalid or missing

# Cloudinary to Pinata Migration - Summary of Changes

## Overview

Successfully migrated the Wallace Collection application from Cloudinary to Pinata for all media file management. This migration provides decentralized IPFS storage, better NFT integration, and automatic file cleanup.

## Files Modified

### Core Library Files

1. **`src/lib/pinataHelpers.ts`** - Enhanced with new functions:

   - `unpinFromPinata()` - Unpin files by CID
   - `uploadToPinata()` - Upload files to Pinata
   - `getPinataTransformedUrl()` - Get transformed URLs for optimization
   - `unpinArtworkCids()` - Unpin all CIDs associated with an artwork
   - `extractCidsFromArtwork()` - Extract IPFS CIDs from artwork objects

2. **`src/lib/mediaHelpers.ts`** - Completely refactored:

   - Replaced all Cloudinary upload logic with Pinata equivalents
   - Updated `handleMediaUpload()` to use Pinata
   - Replaced `uploadToCloudinary()` with `uploadToPinata()`
   - Updated image optimization to work with Pinata

   - Updated filename generation for Pinata compatibility

5. **`src/lib/pinataUtils.ts`** - New file:
   - Created transformation utilities for Pinata
   - Added image presets (thumbnail, small, medium, large, hero)
   - Provided backward compatibility with deprecated `getCloudinaryTransformedUrl()`

### API Endpoints

   - Replaced Cloudinary upload with Pinata upload

2. **`src/routes/api/admin/artworks/create/+server.ts`** - Updated:

   - Replaced Cloudinary upload with Pinata upload
   - Added automatic pinning of IPFS URLs found in artwork metadata

3. **`src/routes/api/admin/artists/create/+server.ts`** - Updated:

   - Replaced Cloudinary upload with Pinata upload for artist avatars

4. **`src/routes/api/admin/artworks/[id]/+server.ts`** - Updated:

   - Added unpinning functionality in DELETE endpoint
   - Files are unpinned before artwork deletion

5. **`src/routes/api/admin/artists/[id]/+server.ts`** - Updated:
   - Added unpinning functionality in DELETE endpoint
   - Unpins artist avatars and all associated artwork files before deletion

### Frontend Files

1. **`src/routes/(dashboard)/admin/collections/+page.svelte`** - Updated:

   - Changed import to use new Pinata transformation utilities

2. **`src/routes/(dashboard)/admin/artworks/edit/[id]/+page.svelte`** - Updated:
   - Updated help text to reference Pinata instead of Cloudinary

### Configuration Files

1. **`package.json`** - Updated:

   - Removed `cloudinary` dependency
   - Kept `pinata` dependency

2. **`package-lock.json`** - Updated:
   - Removed Cloudinary package references

## New Features Added

### 1. Automatic File Cleanup

- Files are automatically unpinned from Pinata when:
  - Artworks are deleted
  - Artists are deleted (including avatars and associated artworks)
  - This prevents accumulation of unused files and reduces storage costs

### 2. IPFS URL Pinning

- When creating artworks, any IPFS URLs found in metadata are automatically pinned to Pinata
- Ensures important NFT assets remain available

### 3. Image Transformations

- Added Pinata-based image transformations (requires custom gateway)
- Created preset transformations for common use cases
- Backward compatibility with existing Cloudinary transformation calls

### 4. Enhanced File Organization

- Files are uploaded with descriptive names for better organization
- Metadata tags are applied for categorization
- Support for Pinata groups for environment separation

## Environment Variables Required

Add to your `.env` file:

```env
# Pinata Configuration
PINATA_JWT=your_pinata_jwt_token_here
PINATA_GATEWAY=your-custom-gateway-subdomain  # Optional
PINATA_GROUP=your_pinata_group_id  # Optional
```

Remove these (no longer needed):

```env
# CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=
# CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=
# CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=
```

## Backward Compatibility

- Existing Cloudinary URLs in the database continue to work
- `getCloudinaryTransformedUrl()` function still available but deprecated
- Gradual migration path - new uploads use Pinata, existing content remains functional

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Decentralized Storage**: Files stored on IPFS through Pinata
2. **Cost Efficiency**: More predictable pricing, automatic cleanup reduces waste
3. **Better NFT Integration**: Native IPFS support for metadata
4. **Improved Organization**: Better file naming and categorization
5. **Automatic Cleanup**: No manual file management needed

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test file uploads for artworks and artists
2. Verify file cleanup when deleting records
3. Test image transformations (if using custom gateway)
4. Monitor Pinata usage and quotas
5. Verify existing Cloudinary URLs still work

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the application for any issues
2. Consider migrating existing Cloudinary URLs to Pinata (optional)
3. Set up monitoring for Pinata usage and quotas
4. Update any remaining frontend components to use new transformation utilities

The migration is complete and the application now uses Pinata for all new media uploads while maintaining backward compatibility with existing Cloudinary content.
